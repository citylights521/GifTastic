## Feedback:
My impulse reaction with this assignment was to do things the long way, such as listing out each of the buttons to display upon download, making more manual paths for those buttons to grab the gif’s in JavaScript, and overall just making the code more complicated and longer then it needed to be. After attending Molly’s pseudo coding session on Monday, I understood that I could in fact use an array to simplify which cut out a TON of code. I am still learning how to be more efficient in my programming, and this project served as a good lesson in that. As the first time using an API, it was deceptively simple for this specific project. There is so little code actually connecting with the Giphy site that it’s a little deceiving and shows how powerful integrating API’s is. Of course there is a lot of code on the JS side to make it all acutally work! Excited for the next Project to see how we integrate multiple API’s.
